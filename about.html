  <p class="text text-4"><span>Our story begins with a couple of guys that love heavy music and kicking each other in the face at local venues back in their heyday. Obviously these actions caused a friendship to form and from it a passion for brewing was realized. This is just the natural progression of things, kids. Now equipped with beards and dad-bods, we are a dynamic partnership driven by a passion for the people in our local communities and a culture dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for everyone we come across.</span></p>

    <div class="text text-7">
      <p><span>Kingsmen Brewing is dedicated to our products, which consist of Mead and Cider. Mead, if you are reading that and wondering, "What the heck is that?" then it is important that you understand the following...</span></p>
      <p><span>Mead is the oldest form of alcohol and the most badass, ever. Knights were sent out by the King in full armor to bust a hive down from a high branch deep in the forest and bring it back to be fermented in an animal hide canteen (most likely a Bear or Lion, you know, some man-eating animals had been skinned) then drank by said King and his Queen. A tradition passed down by the Royals and the Knights that served them, it eventually made it to the library in a book that Kingsmen Brewing founders, Dale Dupree and Brandon Basista, rented out with our sweet library memberships and read up on.</span></p>
      <p><span>Seeing that the founders of our company are also brutal and ruthless individuals (insert sarcasm), Kingsmen Brewing was a no-brainer. So find our local brew right here in Central Florida and remember, we can't wait for you to try our Mead!<br></span></p>
